## 5. Governance, Voting and Procedures of the Network 
As a decentralized network, the actual existence and performance of the Network is dependent on the collective actions of various participants in the Network, including, among others, Validators, Guardians and Token Holders. The Network may not continue to exist and may not perform as expected if such parties cease their activities on the Network. No one, including the Subject Persons, can guarantee that such parties will continue to act or that the Network will continue exist or perform at the expected level. 

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Network is governed by defined voting governance guidelines, as such may be in effect and amended from time to time in accordance with the then-applicable governance framework of the Network. 

If you are a Validator, you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that your activities on the Network are subject to the Validator statement set forth here: [https://], that you will comply with the provisions of such statement in all respects in your activities on the Network and that failure to comply with such provisions may result in penalties in accordance with the then-applicable governance provisions of the Network. 

Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that: (i) only Token Holders who are beneficial owners of Orbs Tokens are permitted to vote or delegate such Orbs Tokens in the course of any governance or decision-making procedure to which such Orbs Tokens have participation rights; (ii) any person holding any Orbs Tokens in the capacity of custodian on behalf of a Token Holder who is not the beneficial owner of such Orbs Tokens shall not have the right to vote, delegate or otherwise participate in the governance of the Network, and shall not take any such action unless expressly instructed to do so by the Token Holder who is the beneficial owner of such Orbs Tokens; (iii) no user shall offer nor accept anything of value in exchange for a vote of any type, except in accordance with any reward system of the Network that may be in effect from time to time, nor shall any user unduly influence the vote of another.

The Network has been designed to provide service cost stability to users and developers by setting the prices of the computing resources required for each type of on-demand service available on the Orbs networks at a certain number of Orbs tokens, which prices have been set forth on the Orbs Operation Fees document at [https://www.orbs.com/pricing](https://www.orbs.com/pricing). The specific prices listed therein are presented in good faith and believed to be correct at the time of publication, however the model presented may be changed from time to time during the launch period, including as the result of ongoing testing of the model and actual results before and during the launch period.

The pricing list for computing services on the Orbs network may be subject to change from time to time, including, without limitation, by replacing such prices with prices based on an index of prices published by third party cloud providers or by other methods of pegging transaction costs on the Orbs network to a dedicated amount of computing capacity.

Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, changes to the specific prices listed on the price list may occur at any time during or after the launch period as a result of adjustments to the pricing model based on the outcome of testing, adjustments to the pricing model based on actual results during the launch period, additional experience in the behavior of the market for dedicated capacity, changes to the information available from third party cloud service providers, changes due to unforeseen cost increases or decreased of cloud computing, and changes initiated by participants in the governance of the Orbs network.

Descriptions of Network Content, Developer Content and End-User Content available on the Network are for your convenience.  

## 9. Links to Third-Party Websites
The Network may include links to websites of third parties. If you click on these links, you will leave the Network. Network participants are not responsible for their content or operation. You should exercise your own judgment in evaluating and using these websites. When you link to these websites, you become subject to their terms and conditions of use and privacy policies.   

## 10. Notifications concerning Blockchain Technology and Virtual Currency
The Network is based on blockchain technology. Furthermore, the Network requires the use of a virtual currency, the Orbs Tokens, for certain aspects of its functionality. Without limitation, the Orbs Tokens are required for Developers to pay transaction fees to Validators for providing the services needed to run their applications on the Network. In addition, participants in the Network’s security, governance and operations model, including Guardians and Token Holders, may utilize the Orbs Tokens in order to participate in the model by direct voting or delegating the vote associated with such Orbs Tokens, and may receive rewards in the form of Orbs Tokens for such activities, all in accordance with the then-applicable security governance and operations model.

Accordingly, when using this Network, you should be aware of the following risks associated with virtual currency, including the Orbs Tokens, and blockchain-based software, including the Network: 

* virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections or similar laws in any jurisdiction;

* legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currency;

* transactions in virtual currency are generally irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;

* some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a “block chain” ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction;

* the value of virtual currency is derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear;

* there is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future;

* the volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss or tax liability over a short period of time;

* the nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack; 

* the nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by You may prevent the access or use of a customer’s virtual currency;

* the Network is likely to experience scheduled and unscheduled downtime, interruptions, delays, hard forks, bugs, viruses, and cyberattacks;

* the Network may from time to time lack features or functionality and/or require maintenance, support or other adjustments; 

* the Network rests or relies on open-source software, and there is a risk that a person introduces weaknesses, bugs, viruses or other malicious code into the core infrastructural elements of the Network causing the system to lose or erase all or a portion of the Orbs Tokens used in connection with the Network; 

* it is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Network and potential uses of Orbs Tokens. It is not possible to predict the success of any development efforts of any party; 

* the actual existence and performance of the Network is dependent on the collective actions of various participants in the Network, including, among others, Validators, Guardians and Token Holders. It is possible that the Network may not continue to exist and may not perform as expected if such parties cease their activities on the Network. No one, including the Subject Persons, can guarantee that such parties will continue to act or that the Network will continue exist or perform at the expected level; 

* you recognize that the Network is under development and may undergo significant changes over time and you acknowledge that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Network held by you may not be met upon release of the Network or any update thereto, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Network; 

* the state of cryptocurrency can advance over time and advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to the Orbs Tokens and the Network, which could result in the theft or loss of Orbs Tokens. To the extent possible, participants in the Network may attempt to update the protocol underlying the Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but the future of cryptography cannot be predicted and there can be no guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner;

* as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Network is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “Selfish-mining” attacks or race condition attacks and any successful attacks present a risk to the Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions in Orbs Tokens, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of participants in the Network, including Validators and Guardians, known or novel mining attacks may be successful. 

* if the Network is rapidly adopted, the demand for Orbs Tokens could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which new Orbs Tokens are released from reserves or otherwise become available for use. Under such a scenario, the entire Network could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Network and Orbs Tokens. Instability in the demand for Orbs Tokens may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Orbs Token-based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation. 

* if the Network is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which Validators can bring online additional computing power. Under such a scenario, the entire Network could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Network and the Orbs Tokens. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of Orbs Tokens could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their applications. 

* It is possible that alternative which utilize the same open-source source code and open source protocol underlying the Network could be established. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Network and the Orbs Tokens; and 

* the Network could be impacted in whole or in part by one or more regulatory or governmental inquiries or actions, which could impede, limit or restrict the use or transfer of Orbs Tokens or otherwise result in the complete or partial loss in value of Orbs Tokens.

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) you are accepting and using the Network and the Orbs tokens at your sole risk and expense; (ii) you have an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens such as the Orbs tokens and blockchain-based software such as the Network, including the risks set forth above; (iii) any and all Subject Persons shall have no responsibility or liability for the loss, transfer, misappropriation, theft, use or misuse of any Orbs Tokens, including as utilized in connection with the Network, or any financial or physical harm or loss related thereto, and you hereby irrevocably waive any and all rights and claims with respect thereto and claims with respect thereto, (iv) you will comply with any and all applicable rules and laws regarding your use of Orbs Tokens, including in connection with the Network and (vi) the Subject Persons not endorse or recommend the use of any software or hardware wallet services and/or market exchanges (including any over-the-counter market) in connection with any storage, transfer or other transaction related to Orbs Tokens, all of which may be used at your sole risk and expense.
