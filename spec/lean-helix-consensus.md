# LeanHelix Consensus Algo
> This document details the LeanHelix plug-in specification, focusing  on switching between consensus rounds. The spec for consensus round is described in [LeanHelixOneHeight](/lean-helix-one-height.md).


## Design Notes
* Consensus is performed in an infinte loop triggered at a given context state. A sync scenario flow, e.g. might shift the consensus loop to a different height.
* This library is dependent on "consumer service" with several context provided functionalities, detailed below (which could alter its behaviour).
* The proposed design involves another partition into an inner constrained module - "LeanHelixOneHeight" - explicitly devoted to a single round PBFT consensus, further detailed in a seperated file.
  * The "multi-height" library is responsible for looping through the correct term _(height)_, setting the relevant context
  * Including filtering old messages and subsequently relaying future messages at appropriate times.
  * Including, generating the BlockProof and new random_seed
* Configuration related queries are goverened by height - e.g. all known federation members at given height.
* The committee memebers are derived at each block height using an aggregated threshold (set to QuorumSize) signature on previous height's random seed.
* The threshold signatrues are passed as part of the COMMIT messaage.
* COMMIT message is passed to one-height after signature on random seed is verified and signer matches COMMIT signer _(committee member of current height handled at one-height members and discarded + reported )
* COMMIT message holds only one Signer - for both COMMIT BlockRef signature and random seed signature.
* When a block is committed the aggregated signature is comprised matching the QuorumSize COMMIT signed messages _(same members)
* Syncing is perfromed by the consuming service (e.g. BlockStorage), but its validity is justified on BlockProof being verified by LeanHelix library.
* The consensus algo doesn't keep PBFT logs of past block_height (erased on commit). A sync of the blockchain history is perfromed by block sync.

## Databases

#### Received Messages Cache
> Stores messages of future block_height pending stateful processing until block_height update.\
> Used to reduce the chance for costly syncs.\
> Discard if message.block_height > my_state.block_height + configurable future_block_height_window.
* Accessed by (Block_height, View, Signer)
* Persistent
* Stores only one valid message per {Block_height, MessageType, Signer, View}
  _(avoid storing duplciates which may be sent as part of an attack)_

#### Random Seed Cache
> Stores random seed signatures for current consensus round.
* Accessed by (Block_height, Signer)
* Not presistent
* Stores only one valid info per {Block_height, Signer}

<!-- #### Previous block cache
* Stores required data from the previous block_height.
 -->


 #### State
> Stores the current state variables.
* State variables:
    * OneHeightContext:
        * Current_block_height (-1)
        * Prev_block_hash ({})
        * Random_seed (0)
    * OneHeight  _(current instance of LeanHelixOneHeight(Current_block_height))_
    * StopHeight (MAX)





&nbsp;
## `OnConsensusMessage(message)`
> Demux message and filter by height.
#### Filter message by block height
* Current_block_height = my_state.OneHeightContext.Current_block_height
* If Current_block_height >= my_state.StopHeight Return  _(stop process at StopHeight)_.
* If message.Block_height > Current_block_height + configurable future_block_height_window - discard.
* If message.Block_height > Current_block_height - store in Future Messages Cache.
* If message.Block_height < Current_block_height - discard.
#### Demux message and pass to One Height PBFT, strip random_seed info from COMMIT
* Determine the message type
* If message type COMMIT:
    * KeyType = Get KeyType to verify for KeyManager.KEY_TYPES.RandomSeed
    <!--  * PublicKey = `KeyManager.GetPublicKey(message.Signer, message.Block_height, KeyType)`  -->
    * Random_seed = my_state.OneHeightContext.Random_seed
    * Validate the random_seed _(current block_height)_ signature by calling `KeyManager.Verify(message.Block_height, Random_seed, message.Random_seed_share, message.Signer, KeyType)`. If failed validation - discard.
    * Log info to random_seed_database:
        * random_seed_data.add({COMMIT message.Block_height, COMMIT message.Signer, COMMIT message.Random_seed_share})
* Call the corresponding `my_state.OneHeight.On<XXX>`
